Roatan Dive Sites for iOS
=========================

An app to show all the dive sites around Roatan on a Google map and allow you to
search for specific sites by name. Useful for new dive masters on the island to
get an idea where everything is in relation to each other, mooring depths and
types, or just those who like geeky maps.

A big thanks to Nick from the Roatan Marine Park for the list of dive sites and
GPS coordinates.

Please excuse the awful code. I wrote this not knowing the first thing about iOS
development and got it functioning how I wanted, but the structure and
conventions of iOS/Objective C are still a mystery to me, and thus the code is
comparable to what a self taught PHP dev might crank out.
